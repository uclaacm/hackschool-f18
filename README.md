# Hackschool Resources - Fall 2018

## Welcome to Hackschool 

It's easy to feel lost in the world of tech or not know where to start. We
created Hackschool to give you a place to start in this wonderful universe of
possibilities. We wanted to fill the gaps between what is taught in class and
what is needed to build change you'd like to see in the world. By the end, you'll have glimpsed a
little bit of everything behind the websites you visit every day.

In this repository, you'll find a guide to all the topics we introduce this
quarter, and links to helpful resources.

We hope you have a blast this quarter, and encourage you to reach out to any of
us if you have any questions or comments.

## What You'll Need for the Entire Course

* A text editor. We recommend [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) as
  a default choice, but [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and
  [Atom](https://atom.io/) are also excellent choices. If you already use
  another editor, that's perfectly fine. Don't worry about using the "best"
  one; any modern editor is more than enough for what we'll tackle this
  quarter.

* Google Chrome: it has the best developer tools and the most market share of
  any web browser

Bonus items (if you have time; these are not needed for frontend web development): 

* Create a GitHub account

* If you're on a Mac, you may later run into issues where software is missing.
  To prevent this, install Xcode from the App Store. Then run `xcode-select --install` in Terminal. This will install command-line tools that we'll need
  later on. Here's a [tutorial with screenshots](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/)

* Download and install the LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
  We don't recommend using the latest version because of how quickly new Node
  versions are introducing, often leading to unexpected breakages when the
  newest version is incompatible with other code you're using.

* (Advanced) If you're on a Mac, you'll eventually want
  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to manage installing command-line tools and
  [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to manage different versions of Node.js.

### Helpful Docs & Tools

* [http://jsbin.com/](http://jsbin.com/) for quick in-browser prototypes

* [Mancy](https://github.com/princejwesley/Mancy) if you want an interactive
  JavaScript prompt (called a REPL: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop)

* [http://codepen.io/](http://codepen.io/) to share ideas with other people

* You'll find the [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) very helpful
for looking up the particulars of a built-in function or CSS property.

* [Modern JavaScript Cheatsheet](https://github.com/mbeaudru/modern-js-cheatsheet/blob/master/readme.md)


### Learning Beyond Hackschool

For HTML and CSS:

* [Interneting is Hard](https://internetingishard.com/) is a beautiful and complete tutorial

For JavaScript: 

* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) if you've never programmed before

* [A Reintroduction to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) if you've touched JS a bit before

* [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) for a free 30-day series of daily
  mini-projects

* [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) to learn the language more deeply

* [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/map) for a massive, highly comprehensive curriculum covering everything you would need to know to start a new career as a software engineer
